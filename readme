This is the work of Austin New, for Arabnia's Programs 1 and 2 (Line Scan-Conversion)
gp (Graphic Package), written in C using SDL for rendering and videocard control.

This requires SDL to compile.

last updated 9/12/11

To compile:
	make compile_line_draw
		or
	make ccompile_time_test

To run:
	./line_draw
		or
	./time_test <iterations> <lines_per_iteration>
	
	line_draw will prompt you to enter the number of line you'd like draw and what iterator you'd like to use.
	Proper input might be "b 12345" or "d 9999", 'b' for Bresenham, and 'd' for DDA.
	Lines are drawn with the screen refresh, otherwise they would appear all at once and disappear.
	To exit the SDL Surface rendering, press any key.
	
	time_test is what I used to run my experiment, whose results may be found in time_comparison_test.txt
	and whose write-up is inside a PDF, hw1_report.pdf
	
To clean:
	make clean
